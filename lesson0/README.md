Erratic Behavior
================

In this first lesson, we're going to build a system that will allow us to generate large lists of random numbers from just a few inputs.  This is a piece of logic that we're going to use in each of the lessons for this tutorial, so keep the code around.

Let's build what is called a Linear Congruential Generator, or LCG - a pseudorandom number generator.  The formula for generating the next number in an LCG is:

![](http://tex.sh/tex/$X_%7Bi%7D%20=%20\(aX_%7Bi-1%7D%20+%20c\)%20/mod%20m$.png)

Where:

 * X<sub>n</sub> is the next item in the generator.
 * a, c, m are integer constants

 
The problems in this section will require you perform either addition or multiplication on the first N numbers generated by this equation.

Input files will consist of a single line containing seven values in the following format:

    a c m X0 N D op
    
Where:

 * a, c, m, and X0 are the initialization values for an LCG
 * N is the number of values, >= 2, that should be included in the operation.  X0 is considered a seed value and should not be included in the calculation.
 * D is an integer value, you will return the result of the reduction modulo this value.
 * op is a single character that describes the reduction operation you'll be performing: `+` represents addition and `*` represents multiplication


From these inputs, an op of `+` will require you to compute ![](http://tex.sh/tex/$/sum_%7B1%7D%5E%7BN%7D%20X_%7Bi%7D%20/mod%20D$.png), and an op of `*` will require you to compute ![](http://tex.sh/tex/$/prod_%7B1%7D%5E%7BN%7D%20X_%7Bi%7D%20/mod%20D$.png).

In order to actually be successful at this problem, you will have to inspect the values provided in each problem set, and figure out the behavior that is implied by the values provided.

Problem Drilldown
=================

Problem 0
-----------------
Just getting started with this one, N, a, c, m, and D are all small values.

Problem 1
-----------------
Things are getting a little tougher here, N is around 10 billion, meaning that is how many values must be multiplied together

Problem 2
-----------------
Once again we are dealing with large N of 2**32, but this time over an addition operation.
